The `update_knn` function should maintain/update an array of k minimum distances per training set given the testing instance and a new training instance. The `knn_vote` function should find the k nearest neighbors among 10 Ã— k minimum distance values and determine the final output based on the most common digit represented by these nearest neighbors. It should call a provided `sort_knn` function to sort the distance values in ascending order. Here is the digitrec.cpp code:\n\n{cpp_code}"
