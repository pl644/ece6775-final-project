# @brief: A Tcl script for the optimization experiments from lab 1 section 4.3
#
# @desc: Fix the design configuration to use 20 iterations and 32-bit signed
# fixed-point type with 8 integer bits. The goal is to maximize the throughput
# of this design using optimization directives provided by Vivado HLS. 
#

# Your Vivado HLS project script goes here
# HINT: You can use run_fixed.tcl as a template. Then, run this script with
# `vivado_hls -f run_opt.tcl`
