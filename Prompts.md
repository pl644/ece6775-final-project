Round 1 Prompt: General Optimization and Initialization Objective: Introduce basic HLS pragma directives to the conv and dense layers to improve performance and lay the groundwork for further optimizations. Prompt: The following code implements the core computations of a CNN accelerator, including: Two convolutional (conv) layers that use three nested loops to perform 2D convolution with binarized weights and inputs. Two fully connected (dense) layers that perform matrix-vector multiplications with binarized weights. Optimization Goals: Reduce the latency of the conv and dense layers. Keep hardware resource utilization (BRAM, LUT, FF, DSP) under 85%. Optimization Requirements: Add basic HLS pragmas, such as pipeline and unroll, to the conv and dense layers. Ensure that the focus is on improving inner loop performance while maintaining resource constraints. Explain the purpose of each pragma directive and how it contributes to reducing latency or improving parallelism. Please output the optimized code snippets with detailed explanations of each pragma's purpose

Round 2 Prompt: Focused Optimization on Bottlenecks and Parallelism Objective: Build upon the results of Round 1 by addressing performance bottlenecks and further improving parallelism and resource efficiency. Prompt: The following CNN implementation has been optimized in Round 1, focusing on pipelining and basic parallelism. While performance has improved, the following bottlenecks remain: The conv layer's input data access speed is limited, leading to higher latency. The dense layer's matrix-vector multiplication suffers from underutilized compute units in the accumulation stage. BRAM usage is at 280%, approaching the upper limit. Optimization Goals: For the conv layer: Use the array partition pragma to reduce memory access conflicts in input or weight arrays. Introduce wider data types (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) to process multiple binary data points simultaneously. For the dense layer: Increase the unroll factor to enhance parallelism in the accumulation loop. Ensure that BRAM utilization remains below 85%. Please output the updated code snippets for conv and dense layers, along with an explanation of each pragma directive's impact on performance and resource usage.



Round 3 Prompt: Comprehensive Tuning and Performance Balancing Objective: Balance performance and resource utilization for the entire CNN, achieving optimal results within the given constraints. Prompt: Based on the optimized CNN implementation, the current performance and resource usage analysis reveals: The loop latency of outermost loop of the conv layer loop is 6980, which needs to be reduced. Meanwhile, reduce the latency of the max pool layers. Optimization Goals: For the max pool layers: Add basic HLS pragmas, such as unroll and pipeline, to the max pool layers. For the conv layers: Add basic HLS pragmas to the conv layers, such as reshape（Carefully adjust the value of factor）. Adjust unroll factors to optimize parallel execution without excessive resource consumption. Increase BRAM resource usage appropriately to help speed up the conv layer Ensure that accuracy remains ≥90% and all the resource utilization especially the LUT does not exceed 85%. Please generate the final optimized code snippets with detailed pragma annotations and explain how they balance performance with resource constraints

Round 4 Prompt: Additional Optimization for Non-Critical Layers Objective: Optimize the non-critical layers (flatten and initialize_padded_memory) to further improve overall performance without significantly impacting resource constraints. Prompt: The following non-critical layers are part of the CNN implementation and can be optimized to improve overall efficiency: flatten: This layer converts a 3D feature map into a 1D vector to be used in dense layers. It involves a nested loop over feature map dimensions. initialize_padded_memory: This layer initializes a padded memory array with a constant value and is used for memory setup. pad: This layer applies padding to input feature maps to prepare for convolution, involving nested loops over spatial dimensions. Optimization Goals: Reduce latency for these non-critical layers to minimize their overhead in the overall pipeline. Ensure these optimizations do not significantly increase resource usage, keeping BRAM, LUT, FF, and DSP usage under 85%. Optimization Requirements: Add basic HLS pragmas (pipeline, unroll) to the non-critical layers (flatten, initialize_padded_memory) to optimize memory access and loop execution. For pad layer, use HLS reshape fully reshape the input arrays and output for the first dim to maximize parallelism. And use the pipeline for the outer loop and fully unroll for the innermost loop.Do not use HLS inline in the pad layer. Do not use the array partition in any non-critical layer. The pipeline should be placed in an inner loop to avoid overspreading and resource consumption. Please generate optimized code snippets for these layers with detailed pragma annotations and explanations of their impact.

Round 5 Prompt: Fianl Optimization for Non-Critical Layers (Sign and Argmax Layers) Objective: Optimize the non-critical layers (sign and argmax) to further improve overall performance without significantly impacting resource constraints. Prompt: The following non-critical layers are part of the CNN implementation and can be optimized to improve overall efficiency: sign:This layer processes a 1D input feature map by applying a sign function element-wise. It determines if each element is positive or non-positive, producing a binary output vector. The layer involves a single loop over the input vector. argmax:This layer computes the index of the maximum value from a 1D input feature map. It involves iterating over the input elements, comparing each value with the current maximum, and updating the maximum value and its index. Optimization Goals: Add basic HLS pragmas (pipeline, unroll,array partition) to the non-critical layers (sign, argmax) to optimize memory access and loop execution. For sign layer，fully array partition the input and output.The pipeline should be outside the loop（II=1）. Reduce latency for these non-critical layers to minimize their overhead in the overall pipeline. Ensure these optimizations do not significantly increase resource usage, keeping BRAM, LUT, FF, and DSP usage under 85%.
